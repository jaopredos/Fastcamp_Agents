      "Upon researching the symptoms of Fever, Headache, Fatigue, Nausea, Shortness of Breath, Diarrhea, and Congestion, the following list of possible diseases and conditions have been identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Influenza (flu): Symptoms such as fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, and congestion are common in influenza infections. Shortness of breath can occur, especially in severe cases.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. COVID-19: This viral infection can present with fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and congestion as some of its symptoms.\n",

      "3. Pneumonia: Both viral and bacterial pneumonia can cause fever, fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, and nausea. Diarrhea can rarely occur as a symptom.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. Gastroenteritis: This condition, commonly known as stomach flu, can cause fever, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue.\n",
      "   \n",
      "5. Acute Bronchitis: Symptoms like fever, headache, fatigue, and congestion are typical in acute bronchitis. Cough may also be present.\n",
      "   \n",
      "6. Asthma Exacerbation: Shortness of breath along with symptoms like fever, headache, and fatigue can be associated with an asthma exacerbation.\n",
      "   \n",
      "7. COVID-19 Variants: Emerging evidence suggests that new variants of the COVID-19 virus may present with varying symptoms, including diarrhea and congestion, in addition to the typical symptoms.\n",
      "   \n",
      "8. Sinusitis: Symptoms such as headache, congestion, fatigue, and sometimes fever are common in sinus infections.\n",
      "   \n",
